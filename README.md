This repository goes along with a [http://devfest.mn/](Google DevFest) talk I gave on geospatial data. There's not much else to say, as the code is all available in the [commented R markdown](https://github.com/jwhendy/devFest-geo/blob/master/devFest-geo_2014-02-08.Rmd) file which you can use with [RStudio](http://www.rstudio.com/).

The `.pdf` presentation is also in the repository, and the `plots/` directory contains all of the plots that were generated from this R code.

The presentation itself was generated from [Emacs](http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/) [Org-mode](http://orgmode.org/), which allows for prose/narrative to be interspersed with code blocks. The `.org` file was exported through Org-mode's highly capable export engine to [LaTeX Beamer](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beamer_(LaTeX)). I have a fair amount of customization in my `.emacs` config and used a custom theme ([Torino](http://blog.barisione.org/2007-09/torino-a-pretty-theme-for-latex-beamer/)), so it might be difficult for you to reproduce the presentation exactly. Nevertheless, if anything above sounds interesting, check out the plain text `.org` file, which can be opened in any text editor to see how Org-mode works.
